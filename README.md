**Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2023**

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2023. The data was obtained from the Canadian Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website.

### Observations

* The top 5 countries contributing the least number of immigrants to Canada are:
    * Palau
    * Western Sahara
    * Marshall Islands
    * New Caledonia
    * San Marino

* The number of immigrants to Canada from Iceland started increasing rapidly after 2008 due to the economic crisis that led to the collapse of the banking sector in Iceland.

* The top 2 countries with the highest number of immigrants to Canada are India and China.

* The number of Haiti immigrants to Canada peaked in 2010 due to the devastating earthquake that struck the country in that year and Canada's improved policy to accept more refugees from Haiti.

* India and China have similar immigration patterns to Canada, which is likely related to the rapid growth of the Chinese and Indian economies during this period, prompting many people to seek greener pastures in Canada.

* The top 5 countries with the highest number of immigrants to Canada are:
    * India
    * China
    * UK
    * Philippines
    * Pakistan

* Asia contributed 62% of the total immigrants to Canada from 1980 to 2023, followed by Africa (15%) and Europe (11.1%).

* Immigration to Canada has a positive correlation with year, meaning that the number of immigrants has increased over time.

* There was a corresponding increase in immigration from Argentina during the 1998-2002 Great Depression and from Brazil during the 1999 Samba Effect, suggesting that economic crises can lead to increased immigration.

**Conclusion**

This analysis provides insights into the patterns and trends of immigration to Canada over the past four decades. The findings suggest that economic factors, such as financial crises and economic growth, play a significant role in immigration decisions. Political and natural disasters can also impact immigration patterns.

### Future Work

This analysis could be extended in a number of ways. For example, it would be interesting to explore the following questions:

* What are the reasons why people choose to immigrate to Canada?
* What are the challenges and opportunities that immigrants face in Canada?
* What are the economic and social impacts of immigration on Canada?

Answering these questions would require further analysis of the data, as well as qualitative research with immigrants themselves.
